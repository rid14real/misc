bluemix-hello-node
================================================================================

A "Hello World" server in node.js sample for Bluemix.

This repo contains a complete sample of a node.js program that you can deploy
on IBM's [Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/) PaaS, which is based on
the [Cloud Foundry open source project](http://cloudfoundry.org/).

Before jumping into the code, make sure you have an IBM ID, by
registering at the
[IBM ID registration](https://www.ibm.com/account/profile/us?page=reg)
page.  You will need the IBM ID to login to Bluemix from the command line.

You will also need to install the `cf` command-line tool, available
here:

* <https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases>

At the time of this writing, the most recent version is `cf v6.1.1`.



install the code for the sample program
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Click the magical button below to deploy the app.

[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy)

or....

From a command/shell terminal
* `cd` into the parent directory you want to install the project in
* `git clone` the project into a child directory
* `cd` into that child directory
* run `npm install` to install dependencies

For example:

    $ cd Projects
    $ git clone https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/bluemix-hello-node

        ... git output here ...

    $ cd bluemix-hello-node

    $ npm install

        ... npm output here ...


run locally
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After installing, run the server using

    npm start

This should print the following to the console.

    bluemix-hello-node: server starting on http://localhost:8080

If instead, you get something like the following, someone is already
using the default port of 8080:

    Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8080/

    events.js:72
        throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event
                  ^
    Error: listen EADDRINUSE
        at errnoException (net.js:901:11)
        at Server._listen2 (net.js:1039:14)
        at listen (net.js:1061:10)
        at Server.listen (net.js:1127:5)
        ...

Once the server is running, test it by visiting the following URL in your
browser:

    http://localhost:8080/

When you visit the above url the content will be Hello World

    Hello World!!!


Next, test it by visiting the following URL in your
browser:

    http://localhost:8080/hello

When you visit the above url the content will be Hello World

    Hello World



logging into Bluemix
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that you have your IBM ID and the `cf` command-line tool (see above),
you can log into Bluemix and the deploy your app.

First you should tell the `cf` command which environment you want to operate
with, with the `cf api` command:

    cf api https://api.ng.bluemix.net

You should see the following output:

    Setting api endpoint to https://api.ng.bluemix.net...
    OK

    API endpoint: https://api.ng.bluemix.net (API version: 2.0.0)
    Not logged in. Use 'cf login' to log in.
    No org or space targeted, use 'cf target -o ORG -s SPACE'

Note that as long as you only ever interact with the Bluemix environment with the
`cf` command (and not any other CloudFoundry environments), you won't have to
run the `cf api` command again.

To login to Bluemix, use the following command:

    cf login

You will be prompted for your IBM ID userid and password, as in the following
example:

    $ cf login
    API endpoint: https://api.ng.bluemix.net

    Username> [enter your IBM ID here]

    Password> [enter your IBM ID password here]
    Authenticating...
    OK

You will then be prompted to select your 'org' and 'space', just select the defaults,
which should be your IBM ID userid and `dev`, respectively.

When complete, you should see the following:

    API endpoint: https://api.ng.bluemix.net (API version: 2.0.0)
    User:         [your IBM ID]
    Org:          [your IBM ID]
    Space:        dev



deploying to Bluemix
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can deploy an application to Bluemix with the `cf push` command.

Use the following command to have the application deployed to Bluemix:

    cf push

`cf push` will read the default manifest file `manifest.yml` for some
default values of options related to your application.

Note that in the documentation below, the string `${random-word}` is a
place-holder for a random string that Bluemix will create, so that you
will have a unique hostname running within Bluemix.

After running the `cf push` command above, you should see the following output:

    Creating app hello-node in org <my-IBM-id> / space dev as <my-IBM-id>...
    OK

    Using route hello-node-${random-word}.ng.bluemix.net
    Binding hello-node-${random-word}.ng.bluemix.net to hello-node...
    OK

    Uploading hello-node...

At this point, your application is running and you can visit it on the urls

    http://hello-node-${random-word}.ng.bluemix.net
    https://hello-node${random-word}.ng.bluemix.net

If you'd like to continue to play with the server by changing the code, use
the following command when you are ready to push the new version to Bluemix:

    cf push

You can stop the server at any time, by using the following command:

    cf stop hello-node

and then start it later, by using the following command:

    cf start hello-node

When you're ready to delete the server, use the following command:

    cf delete hello-node

privacy notice
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This web application includes code to track deployments to [IBM Bluemix](https://www.bluemix.net/) and other Cloud Foundry platforms. The following information is sent to a [Deployment Tracker](https://github.com/cloudant-labs/deployment-tracker) service on each deployment:

* Application Name (`application_name`)
* Space ID (`space_id`)
* Application Version (`application_version`)
* Application URIs (`application_uris`)

This data is collected from the `VCAP_APPLICATION` environment variable in IBM Bluemix and other Cloud Foundry platforms. This data is used by IBM to track metrics around deployments of sample applications to IBM Bluemix to measure the usefulness of our examples, so that we can continuously improve the content we offer to you. Only deployments of sample applications that include code to ping the Deployment Tracker service will be tracked.

### disabling deployment tracking

Deployment tracking can be disabled by removing the `require("cf-deployment-tracker-client").track();` line from the end of the `server.js` file.

files in this repository
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`server.js`

The server written with node.js.  This server was adapted from the
*[example provided in the node docs](http://nodejs.org/api/synopsis.html)*.

The difference is that the port, binding host, and url are determined
via the [`cfenv` package](https://www.npmjs.org/package/cfenv).  This will
return appropriate values both when running in Cloud Foundry and when running
locally.

`.cfignore`

List of file patterns that should **NOT** be uploaded to Bluemix.

See the Cloud Foundry doc
*[Prepare to Deploy an Application](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/prepare-to-deploy.html)*
for more information.

In this case, the contents of the file are:

    node_modules

This indicates the node modules you installed with `npm install` will **NOT** be
uploaded to Bluemix.  When your app is "staged" (ie, built on Bluemix during
`cf push`), an
`npm install` will be run there to install the required modules.  By avoiding
sending your node modules when you push your app, your app will be uploaded
quicker than
if you **HAD** sent the modules.  But you can send the modules you have installed
if you like; just delete the `.cfignore` file.

---

`.gitignore`

List of file patterns that should **NOT** be stored in git.  If you aren't using
git, you don't need this file.  And the contents are personal preference.

See the npm google groups topic
*['node_modules in git' from FAQ](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/npm-/8SRXhD6uMmk)*
for discussion.

`LICENSE`

The open source license for this sample; in this case, it's licensed under
[Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

---

`manifest.yml`

This file contains information that's used when you `cf push` the application.

See the Cloud Foundry doc
*[Deploying with Application Manifests](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html)*
for more information.

---

`package.json`

Standard package.json file for node packages.  You will need this file for two
reasons:

* identify your node package dependencies during `npm install`
* identify to Bluemix that this directory contains a node.js application

See the npm doc
*[package.json](https://npmjs.org/doc/json.html)*
for more information.

---

`Procfile`

Used to indicate the command to start the server.

See the Cloud Foundry doc
*[Tips for Node.js Applications](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/node/node-tips.html)*
and the Heroku doc
*[Process Types and the Procfile](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile)*
for more information.

In this case, the file has a single line:

    web: node server

This indicates that the command `node server` should be run when the app is
started.
